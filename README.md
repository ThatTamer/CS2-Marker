# Info
This plugin is intended for use only on CS2 Jailbreak servers and may not work as needed on other servers.

Built off of CounterStrikeSharp ver. 1.0.316.

# Features
* CT (Guard) only marker placement,
* Markers appear where the player is aiming,
* Prevents duplicate markers with only one marker being allowed for use,
* Light-weight and optimized for Jailbreak servers,
